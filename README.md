N741 Lecture and Exercises on Data Wrangling

Given on January 25, 2017.

1. Click on the MD file "datawrangling.md" which will contain the R code chunks AND the R output.

2. You can open and run through the R code chunks individually and interactively if you open the RMD file in RStudio.

3. Also look at the HTML, PDF and WORD document formats to see how the output varies between them - especially the tables.

4. Hint: You can't directly view the HTML file from inside Github. 
    + Instead, get the URL for the HTML RAW File - for example [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melindahiggins2000/N741DataWrangling/master/datawrangling.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melindahiggins2000/N741DataWrangling/master/datawrangling.html) but type the following in front of this URL `http://htmlpreview.github.com/?`
    + So, the full URL to view this HTML file in the browset is [http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melindahiggins2000/N741DataWrangling/master/datawrangling.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melindahiggins2000/N741DataWrangling/master/datawrangling.html)
    + This feature can also be accessed using the "preview" site at [https://htmlpreview.github.io/](https://htmlpreview.github.io/)
